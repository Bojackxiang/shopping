./speckit.constitution 'Establish project principles for a Shopping + Admin website for a beaded bracelets store (selling pearls and crystal diamond bracelets). This website should have two main parts:

1. The customer-facing site (browsing products, adding to cart, purchasing, mobile & desktop friendly).
2. The admin site (merchants can upload/manage products, manage inventory, view and update orders, etc).
   The design should be minimalist, modern, and follow 2025 design trends, matching the fashionable jewelry style.'
